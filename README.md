# 🕸️ NVIDIA Sentinel: Supply Chain Intelligence Agent

**NVIDIA Sentinel** is an AI-powered Agentic Intelligence system designed to map and monitor the complex dependencies of the semiconductor supply chain of NVIDIA. By utilizing **GraphRAG** (Knowledge Graphs + RAG), Sentinel uncovers "multi-hop" risks that traditional vector-based search engines miss.

## 🚀 The Core Innovation
Traditional RAG finds "similar text." **Sentinel** understands "relationships." 
If a user asks about a drought in Taiwan, Sentinel doesn't just find articles about water; it traverses the graph: 
`[Taiwan Drought] -> [TSMC Fabrication] -> [NVIDIA Blackwell Series] -> [Revenue Impact]`.

## 🏗️ What I Built (and Learned)

Instead of a standard RAG pipeline, I implemented **Graph RAG**. Here’s the workflow I engineered:

*   **Autonomous Ingestion:** I used the NewsAPI to scrape unstructured news specifically related to NVIDIA.
*   **The "Brain" (Agentic Architecture):** I implemented a semantic router using `LangChain` that intelligently directs traffic. It differentiates between general chatter and complex data queries, ensuring cost-efficiency.
*   **Text-to-Cypher with Transparency:** The model translates natural language into Neo4j Cypher queries. Crucially, I built it to be **"White-Box"**—it shows the generated code to the user, ensuring trust and explainability for enterprise analysts. It traverses the graph to find multi-hop answers.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Agentic Intent Routing:** Automatically distinguishes between general chat and complex data queries using `LangChain`.
* **Text-to-Cypher Engine:** Translates natural language into verified Neo4j queries with built-in hallucination guards.
* **Automated Knowledge Ingestion:** A specialized ETL pipeline that scrapes news (NewsAPI/BeautifulSoup) and extracts entities via `LLMGraphTransformer`.
* **Interactive Visualizer:** A "Neural Grid" UI built with Streamlit and Glassmorphism CSS for real-time graph exploration.
* **Pro-Level Citations:** Every insight generated is linked directly back to its source article node via `[:MENTIONED_IN]` relationships.
